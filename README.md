# RelTopic: A Graph-Based Semantic Relatedness Measure in Topic Ontologies 

We present RelTopic, a novel graph-based semantic relatedness measure in topic ontologies for topic labeling purposes. RelTopic is applied in the context of `Cultural Heritage`, specifically old press articles. This study is part of the European project `ASTURIAS` (Structural Analysis and Semantic Indexing of Newspaper Articles). 

To apply RelTopic, a topic ontology named Topic-OPA is developed from press articles represented by a set of named entities that disambiguated using Wikidata URIs. RelTopic is also tested in recent newspaper articles.
